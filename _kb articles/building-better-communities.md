The following section gives you some tips, tricks and resources for fostering your community and making it a success!

We hope you find it useful and that it serves as a good introduction into site management and the wonderful community behind WordPress and BuddyPress.

If you still have questions after reading this guide, please feel free to get in touch through our community forums.

## An Introduction to WordPress and BuddyPress

If you are reading this it means that you’re interested in building a community powered by WordPress and BuddyPress for your business, non-profit, cause or academic community. Right?! Maybe you are still in the planning stages and looking for the best software to build your social network, or you’re planning to migrate an existing community to a WordPress/BuddyPress installation. In both cases you need to get yourself familiar with some of the terms and concepts of building social networks using WordPress and BuddyPress.

We’ve collected some of the best articles and videos to help you quickly get a grasp of the possibilities.

## Security and Maintenance

Keeping your community up to date and safe from attacks should have a priority for every site owner. Especially if you allow registrations on your site it’s critical that you take the privacy and thus security of your users serious. This means making sure to upgrade your plugins, themes and WordPress itself when new versions are released and “hardening” your installation.

Below are some articles we consider required reading and give you a crash course in security and maintenance.

## Recommended Plugins

There are thousands and thousands of plugins available for WordPress and BuddyPress and it’s a challenge to figure out which plugins are the best fit for your needs. When selecting a plugin it’s not just a matter of functionality, it’s also about code quality, support and updates from the developer.

This is why we’ve created a repository of curated and vetted plugins that is maintained by WeFoster and our community of site owners. This allows you to pick the plugins you need for your community with the safety of knowing that the plugin is supported, maintained and of high code quality.

Our repository allows you to browse, search and filter for plugins based on various criteria. If you have a WeFoster account you can bookmark plugins and let other members if you’re currently using a certain plugin for your community.

## Hosting Recommendations

Finding high quality web hosting for your community can be quite a challenge. We’ve seen many amazing BuddyPress communities fail simply because of unreliable and slow hosting.

Your site needs to be fast and accessible at all times, if you ever want it to be successful! BuddyPress is social networking done on WordPress, and social networking is an entirely different beast than a blog. Keep this in mind when picking your host.

We’ve written an extensive hosting guide that gives you a crash course in the various types of hosting out there and the ones we’d recommend.
